# Airbnb-Booking-Service
Welcome! This is the booking service for a property reservation app built using a service-oriented architecture, similar to AirBnB.

Specifically, most of my work here was built upon an [existing legacy code base.](https://github.com/thefabfour/booking-service)

The legacy front end of the service was already satisfactory, I was concerned with the back end's **ability to handle multiple clients at once.**
